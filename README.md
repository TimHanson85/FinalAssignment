# FinalAssignment
Primer final assignment
I want to try to figure out the javaScript and Jquery assignment. Its alot for me to do but I want to try. I do enjoy the bootstrap stuff and reserve the right to change my mind. I know I am still behind but feel more confident and dont want to lose it. I will continue to hastle you and pick your brain for more and more information.
